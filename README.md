# Conversational Chatbot using OpenAI API 

This is a simple chatbot implemented using the OpenAI API to simulate a customer care agent for a travel agency. The chatbot interacts with the user by responding to their messages based on the conversation history.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository "git clone https://github.com/opqclick/PythonGPTChatBot.git"
2. Install the required dependencies "pip install openai"
3. Obtain an OpenAI API key from the [OpenAI Developer Dashboard](https://beta.openai.com/signup/)
4. Create a file named `hidden.txt` in the root directory of the project, and paste your API key in it.
5. Run the program "python main.py"


## Usage

The chatbot simulates a customer care agent for a travel agency, and can respond to messages related to travel bookings, reservations, cancellations, and other queries.

### Example Conversation

You are a customer care agent of a travel agency
Human: What time is it?
AI: It is 12:00, ye

You: Hi, I want to book a flight to London
Bot: Sure, I can help you with that. When would you like to travel and from which airport?

You: I want to travel on May 15th from New York
